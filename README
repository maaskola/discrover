Documentation
=============

The sub-directory doc contains a manual for this package, written in LaTeX.
A PDF version of the manual will be generated during the build process of this
package, and can subsequently be found doc/documentation.pdf.





Dependencies
============

This software depends on other software. During the configuration phase it is
checked whether these packages are found on your system.
The dependencies are:


A C++11 supporting compiler
This software package is written in C++11, so it is necessary to use an
up-to-date version of your compiler. The GNU compiler collection supports all
necessary features to compile this project as of version 4.6.


Cmake
http://www.cmake.org/
We use CMake to construct Makefiles to build discrover.


Boost C++ libraries
http://www.boost.org/
We make use of code in the Boost C++ libraries, so please install it.
These libraries are available under the Boost License
http://www.boost.org/users/license.html
The version of Boost must be recent enough to include the V3 filesystem library.
Version 1.48 and more recent versions are known to work.


OpenMP
We use OpenMP to support parallelization. As of version 4.2 the GCC supports
OpenMP out of the box, so we suggest building with a recent compiler version.


R library
We are using code from the R library to compute the logarithm of the chi-square
distribution function.  During configuration it is checked if the R library is
found. If that is the case then we link to it, otherwise code extracted from it
is built and used.


DREME from the MEME suite
http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/
Optionally, the program DREME from the MEME suite of motif analysis tools can be
integrated for seeding of HMM motifs. During configuration it is checked if any
programs named 'dreme' or 'meme-dreme' can be found. If that is the case, you
will be able to use DREME for motif seeding by specifying --algo dreme.




Building
========

Please refer to the file INSTALL in the main directory of this package.





How to run
==========

Below is a minimal description on how use this package. Please refer to the
manual in doc/documentation.pdf for more information.

The package contains two binaries, plasma and discrover.

Plasma is used to find IUPAC regular expression type motifs, and discrover learns
HMMs. Both use discriminative objective functions.
If no seeds are specified for discrover, plasma will be used to find seeds auto-
matically.

Please refer to the command line help, which is available after installing with

discrover -h
  or
discrover --help

Similarly:

plasma -h
  or
plasma --help


Note that some infrequently used options are hidden by default, and may be shown
with the verbose switch:

discrover -hv

Even more obscure options are available by adding the very verbose switch:

discrover -hV
