distribution probabilities by means of the incomplete Gamma function.




Dependencies
============

This software depends on other software. During the configuration phase it is
checked whether these packages are found on your system.
The dependencies are:


A C++11 supporting compiler
This software package is written in C++11, so it is necessary to use an
up-to-date version of your compiler. The GNU compiler collection supports all
necessary features to compile this project as of version 4.6.

Cmake
http://www.cmake.org/
We use CMake to construct Makefiles to build dlhmm.

Boost C++ libraries
http://www.boost.org/
We make use of code in the Boost C++ libraries, so please install it.
These libraries are available under the Boost License
http://www.boost.org/users/license.html
The version of Boost must be recent enough to include the V3 filesystem library.


OpenMP
We use OpenMP to support parallelization. As of version 4.2 the GCC supports
OpenMP out of the box, so we suggest building with a recent compiler version.


R library
We are using code from the R library to compute the logarithm of the chi-square
distribution function.  During configuration it is checked if the R library is
found. If that is the case then we link to it, otherwise code extracted from it
is built and used.




Building
========

Please refer to the file INSTALL in the main directory of this package.





How to run
==========

Please refer to the command line help, which is available after installing with

hmm -h
  or
hmm --help


Note that some infrequently used options are hidden by default, and may be shown
with the verbose switch:

hmm -hv

Even more obscure options are available by adding the very verbose switch:

hmm -hV
