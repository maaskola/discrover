.PP
This program runs a progressive algorithm, which in each iteration determines
the IUPAC word with the highest residual score that is enriched in the signal
sequences, accepts it, and masks all occurrences or removes all sequences in
which it occurs, before proceeding.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR [ \fB\-\-fasta\fR ] arg
FASTA file definition. May be given multiple times.
Syntax as follows:
.IP
[NAMES:[CONTRAST:]]PATH
.TP
NAMES
comma\-separated list of names of motifs
enriched in this file
.TP
CONTRAST name of a contrast this file belongs to
PATH     path of FASTA file with sequences
.IP
NAMES and CONTRAST are optional.
.TP
FASTA files can be grouped into contrasts on which the
\fB\-\-score\fR definitions (see below) can act.
.TP
If the path contains at least one colon, please prepend
with colons to disambiguate.
.TP
Note: usage of \fB\-f\fR / \fB\-\-fasta\fR is optional; all free
arguments are taken to be paths of FASTA files.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR [ \fB\-\-motif\fR ] arg
Motif definition. May be given multiple times. Syntax
as follows:
.IP
[NAME:]MOTIFSPEC
.TP
NAME
name of the motif
.IP
MOTIFSPEC motif specification; see below
.IP
NAME is optional.
.TP
MOTIFSPEC can be given in multiple ways:
1. Using the IUPAC code for nucleic acids.
2. A length specification. Motifs of the indicated
.TP
lengths are sought. A length specification is a
comma separated list of length ranges, where a
length range is either a single length, or an
expression of the form 'x\-y' to indicate lengths x
up to y. A length specification also allows to
specify a multiplicity separated by an 'x'. Thus
examples are '8' for just length 8, '5\-7' for
lengths 5, 6, and 7, '5\-8x2' for two motifs of
lengths 5 to 8, '5\-8,10x3' for three motifs of
lengths 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10.
.TP
3. By specifying the path to a file with a PWM. If the
path contains at least one colon, please prepend
colons to disambiguate.
.TP
\fB\-\-score\fR arg (=mi)
Score definition. May be given multiple times. Syntax
as follows:
.IP
[MOTIF:[CONTRASTS:]]MEASURE
.TP
MOTIF
name of the motif to optimize
.TP
CONTRASTS contrast specification
MEASURE   significance measure to use
See below for details.
.IP
MOTIF and CONTRASTS are optional.
.TP
If no motif name is given, all motifs are optimized
with this score specification. It is an error when more
than one score specification is given for any motif.
.TP
The contrast specification is a set of contrast names
prefixed by '+' or '\-' to indicate whether the score on
the contrast is to count positively or negatively. The
first contrast name, if lacking a '+' or '\-', is taken
to count positively.
.TP
The following significance measures are available:
none    Do not perform learning
bw      Likelihood using Baum\-Welch
viterbi Viterbi learning
mi      Mutual information of condition and motif
.TP
occurrence (MICO)
ri      Rank mutual information
mmie    Maximum mutual information estimation (MMIE),
.TP
a.k.a. posterior classification probability
mcc     Matthews correlation coefficient
dlogl   Log\-likelihood difference, like DME, see doi:
.TP
10.1073/pnas.0406123102
dfreq   Difference of frequency of sequences with motif
.TP
occurrences, similar to DIPS and DECOD, see
doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl227 and
10.1093/bioinformatics/btr412
.TP
\fB\-r\fR [ \fB\-\-revcomp\fR ]
Respect motif occurrences on the reverse complementary
strand. Useful for DNA sequence motif analysis. Default
is to consider only occurrence on the forward strand.
.TP
\fB\-\-nseq\fR arg (=0)
Use only the first N sequences of each file. Use 0 to
indicate all sequences.
.TP
\fB\-\-algo\fR arg (=plasma)
Seeding algorithm. Available are 'plasma', 'mcmc',
\&'dreme', and 'all'. Multiple algorithms can be used by
separating them by comma.
.TP
\fB\-\-any\fR
Whether to allow motifs enriched in the opposite
direction.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter\fR arg (=mask)
How to filter motif occurrences upon identifying a
motif. Available are 'remove' and 'mask'.
.TP
\fB\-\-cand\fR arg (=100)
How many candidates to maintain.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR [ \fB\-\-deg\fR ] arg
Which degrees of degeneracy to consider. May be given
multiple times. A sequence of length N has a maximal
degeneracy of 3*N. Unlimited if unspecified.
.TP
\fB\-\-rdeg\fR arg (=1)
Limit relative degeneracy. 1 corresponds to full
degeneracy, and 0 to no degeneracy. For a sequence of
length N the degeneracy is maximally 3*N. Thus for a
motif of length 8 a maximal relative degeneracy of 0.2
allows (rounded down) 4 degrees of degeneracy.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR [ \fB\-\-generalize\fR ]
Whether to report the best motifs at each level of
degeneracy. Default is to report only the best motif
across all levels of degeneracy. In addition, the best
motifs of levels of degeneracy given by \fB\-\-deg\fR will be
reported.
.TP
\fB\-\-best\fR
Whether to report only the single best motif for each
motif specification.  Default is to report for each
motif specification the best result for each length.
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
Do not allow insignificant seeds.
.TP
\fB\-\-fix_mspace\fR
Deactivate dynamic motif space mode. Influences how the
multiple\-testing correction for the log\-p value of the
G\-test is calculated.
.TP
\fB\-\-allowIUPAC\fR
Interpret IUPAC wildcard symbols in FASTA files. When
this option is used e.g. S (strong) matches C and G,
and so on. Importantly, N matches any character! Use
non\-IUPAC characters for positions where the sequence
is unknown or masked, e.g. you could use '\-' for this.
By default, only A, C, G, and T characters (and their
lower case variants) are encoded while all other
characters are interpreted as masked.
.TP
\fB\-\-weight\fR
When combining objective functions across multiple
contrasts, combine values by weighting with the number
of sequences per contrasts.
.TP
\fB\-\-pcount\fR arg (=1)
The number of pseudo counts to add to each cell of
contingency tables.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR [ \fB\-\-word\fR ]
Perform nucleotide level statistics instead of on
sequence level.
.TP
\fB\-\-time\fR
Output information about how long certain parts take to
execute.
.TP
\fB\-\-print\fR
Print out sequences annotated with motif occurrences.
.TP
\fB\-\-bed\fR
Generate a BED file with positions of motif occurrence.
.TP
\fB\-\-threads\fR arg
Number of threads. If not given, as many are used as
there are CPU cores on this machine.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR [ \fB\-\-output\fR ] arg
Output file names are generated from this label. If not
given, the output label will be 'plasma_XXX' where XXX
is a string to make the label unique. The output files
comprise:
If \fB\-\-pdf\fR or \fB\-png\fR are used, sequence logos of the found
motifs are generated with file names based on this
output label.
.TP
\fB\-\-salt\fR arg

for sequence shuffle generation and MCMC sampling). Set
this to get reproducible results.
.SS "MCMC optimization options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-temp\fR arg (=0.001)
When performing MCMC sampling use this temperature. The
temperatures of parallel chains is decreasing by
factors of two.
.TP
\fB\-\-maxiter\fR arg (=1000) Maximal number of iterations to perform during MCMC
seeding.
.TP
\fB\-\-partemp\fR arg (=6)
Parallel chains to run for parallel tempering.

Which kind of logo to create; 'info' for
information\-type sequence logo (position height scaled

.TP
\fB\-\-alphabet\fR arg

left unspecified, 'DNA' is chosen if \fB\-\-revcomp\fR is used,
