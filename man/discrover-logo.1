Generate sequence logos.
.SS "Usage:"
.IP
discrover\-logo path.hmm ... [options]
.PP
Note that multiple paths can be given.
.SS "Basic options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-hmm\fR arg
Path to .hmm file. May be given multiple times. Note:
free arguments are also interpreted as .hmm files.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR [ \fB\-\-iupac\fR ] arg
A motif given as a IUPAC regular expression. May be
given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR [ \fB\-\-matrix\fR ] arg
Path to a file with a motif in matrix form. May be
given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR [ \fB\-\-output\fR ] arg
Output file names are generated from this label. If
this option is not specified the output label will be
\&'discrover\-logo_XXX' where XXX is a string to make the
label unique.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR [ \fB\-\-help\fR ]
Produce help message.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print out the version.
.SS "Sequence logo creation options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-nopdf\fR
Do not generate PDF files with sequence logos of the
found motifs.
.TP
\fB\-\-nopng\fR
Do not generate PNG files with sequence logos of the
found motifs.
.TP
\fB\-\-axes\fR
Include axes in sequence logos.
.TP
\fB\-\-logo\fR arg (=info)
Which kind of logo to create; 'info' for
information\-type sequence logo (position height scaled
by information content), 'freq' for frequency logo.
.TP
\fB\-\-alphabet\fR arg
Which alphabet to use; can be either 'RNA' or 'DNA'. If
left unspecified, 'DNA' is chosen if \fB\-\-revcomp\fR is used,
and 'RNA' otherwise.
.TP
\fB\-\-order\fR arg (=freq)
How to vertically order the nucleotides; can be either
\&'alpha' for alphabetic order or 'freq' for most
frequent at top.
.TP
\fB\-\-pal\fR arg (=default)
Color palette to use; available are 'default',
\&'solarized', 'tetrad'.
.TP
\fB\-\-scale\fR arg (=100)
Height in pixels of the nucleotide stacks in the
sequence logos.
.TP
\fB\-\-absent\fR arg (=0.03)
Use this frequency for absent nucleotides when creating
logos for IUPAC regular expression motifs.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR [ \fB\-\-revcomp\fR ]
Generate sequence logos for forward and reverse
complementary strand.
