.SH SYNOPSIS
.B discrover-logo
[
.B options
]
[ \fIfile\fR ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Generates sequences logos in PDF and PNG format from either:
.IP * 3
".hmm" files generated by
.B discrover
.IP *
IUPAC regular expression motifs
.IP *
files with motifs in matrix form
.SS "Basic options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-hmm \fIpath
Path to .hmm file.
May be given multiple times.
Note: free arguments are also interpreted as .hmm files.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR [ \fB\-\-iupac\fR ]\fI motif
A \fImotif\fR in the form of a IUPAC regular expression.
May be given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR [ \fB\-\-matrix\fR ]\fI path
Path to a file with a motif in matrix form.
May be given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR [ \fB\-\-output\fR ]\fI label
Output file names are generated from this label.
If this option is not specified the output label will be
\&'discrover\-logo_XXX' where XXX is a string to make the
label unique.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR [ \fB\-\-help\fR ]
Produce help message.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print out the version.
.SS "Sequence logo creation options:"
.TP
.B \-\-nopdf
Do not generate PDF files with sequence logos of the
found motifs.
.TP
.B \-\-nopng
Do not generate PNG files with sequence logos of the
found motifs.
.TP
.B \-\-axes
Include axes in sequence logos.
.TP
.B \-\-logo\fI arg\fR (=info)
Which kind of logo to create; 'info' for information\-type sequence logo (position height scaled by information content), 'freq' for frequency logo.
.TP
\fB\-\-alphabet\fI arg
Which alphabet to use; can be either 'RNA' or 'DNA'.
If left unspecified, 'DNA' is chosen if \fB\-\-revcomp\fR is used, and 'RNA' otherwise.
.TP
\fB\-\-order\fI arg\fR (=freq)
How to vertically order the nucleotides; can be either
\&'alpha' for alphabetic order or 'freq' for most
frequent at top.
.TP
\fB\-\-pal\fI arg\fR (=default)
Color palette to use; available are 'default',
\&'solarized', 'tetrad'.
.TP
\fB\-\-scale\fI num\fR (=100)
Height in pixels of the nucleotide stacks in the
sequence logos.
.TP
\fB\-\-absent\fI float\fR (=0.03)
Use this frequency for absent nucleotides when creating
logos for IUPAC regular expression motifs.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR [ \fB\-\-revcomp\fR ]
Generate sequence logos for forward and reverse
complementary strand.
