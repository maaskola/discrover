  abstract = {We present a statistical-mechanical selection theory for the sequence
	analysis of a set of specific DNA regulatory sites that makes it
	possible to predict the relationship between individual base-pair
	choices in the site and specific activity (affinity). The theory
	is based on the assumption that specific DNA sequences have been
	selected to conform to some requirement for protein binding (or activity),
	and that all sequences that can fulfil this requirement are equally
	likely to occur. In most cases, the number of specific DNA sequences
	that are known for a certain DNA-binding protein is very small, and
	we discuss in detail the small-sample uncertainties that this leads
	to. When applied to the binding sites for cro repressor in phage
	lambda, the theory can predict, from the sequence statistics alone,
	their rank order binding affinities in reasonable agreement with
	measured values. However, the statistical uncertainty generated by
	such a small sample (only 6 sites known) limits the result to order-of-magnitude
	comparisons. When applied to the much larger sample of Escherichia
	coli promoter sequences, the theory predicts the correlation between
	in vitro activity (k2KB values) and homology score (closeness to
	the consensus sequence) observed by Mulligan et al. (1984). The analysis
	of base-pair frequencies in the promoter sample is consistent with
	the assumption that base-pairs at different positions in the sites
	contribute independently to the specific activity, except in a few
	marginal cases that are discussed. When the promoter sites are ordered
	according to predicted activities, they seem to conform to the Gaussian
	distribution that results from a requirement for maximal sequence
	variability within the constraint of providing a certain average
	activity. The theory allows us to compare the number of specific
	sites with a certain activity to the number that would be expected
	from random occurrence in the genome. While strong promoters are
	"overspecified", in the sense that their probability of random occurrence
	is very low, random sequences with weak promoter-like properties
	are expected to occur in very large numbers. This leads to the conclusion
	that functional specificity is based on other properties in addition
	to primary sequence recognition; some possibilities are discussed.
	Finally, we show that the sequence information, as defined by Schneider
	et al. (1986), can be used directly (at least in the case of equilibrium
	binding sites) to estimate the number of protein molecules that are
	specifically bound at random "pseudosites" in the genome.(ABSTRACT

  title = {{A} survey of {DNA} motif finding algorithms.},
  journal = {{BMC} {B}ioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8 Suppl 7},
  pages = {S21},
  abstract = {Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major
	challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify
	regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic
	acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short
	DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence
	availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies
	have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif
	finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms
	have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the
	past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif
	finding algorithms.Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated
	genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented
	motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting
	or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter
	sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are
	used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly
	detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory
	experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel
	motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been
	shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but
	perform significantly worse in higher organisms.Despite considerable
	efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for
	biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different
	approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made
	in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison
	of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools
	have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based
	on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our
	incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does
	not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over
	motif models.},

	the MatrixREDUCE algorithm, which uses genome-wide occupancy data
	for a transcription factor (e.g. ChIP-chip) and associated nucleotide
	sequences to discover the sequence-specific binding affinity of the
	transcription factor. Advantages of our approach are that the information
	for all probes on the microarray is efficiently utilized because
	there is no need to delineate "bound" and "unbound" sequences, and
	that, unlike information content-based methods, it does not require
	a background sequence model.We validated the performance of MatrixREDUCE
	by inferring the sequence-specific binding affinities for several
	transcription factors in S. cerevisiae and comparing the results
	with three other independent sources of transcription factor sequence-specific
	affinity information: (i) experimental measurement of transcription
	factor binding affinities for specific oligonucleotides, (ii) reporter
	gene assays for promoters with systematically mutated binding sites,
	and (iii) relative binding affinities obtained by modeling transcription
	factor-DNA interactions based on co-crystal structures of transcription
	factors bound to DNA substrates. We show that transcription factor
	binding affinities inferred by MatrixREDUCE are in good agreement

	these interactions also define many functional features of the genome.
	SBF and MBF are sequence-specific transcription factors that activate
	gene expression during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle in yeast.
	SBF is a heterodimer of Swi4 and Swi6, and MBF is a heterodimer of
	Mbpl and Swi6 (refs 1, 3). The related Swi4 and Mbp1 proteins are
	the DNA-binding components of the respective factors, and Swi6 mayhave

	have been identified. Here we define the genomic binding sites of

	In addition to the previously characterized targets, we have identified

	how protein primary structure is determined by DNA sequence. DNA
	also dictates when and where proteins are expressed, and this information
	is encoded in a pattern of specific sequence motifs that are recognized
	by transcription factors. However, the DNA-binding specificity is
	only known for a small fraction of the approximately 1400 human transcription
	factors (TFs). We describe here a high-throughput method for analyzing
	transcription factor binding specificity that is based on systematic
	evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and massively
	parallel sequencing. The method is optimized for analysis of large
	numbers of TFs in parallel through the use of affinity-tagged proteins,
	barcoded selection oligonucleotides, and multiplexed sequencing.
	Data are analyzed by a new bioinformatic platform that uses the hundreds
	of thousands of sequencing reads obtained to control the quality
	of the experiments and to generate binding motifs for the TFs. The
	described technology allows higher throughput and identification
	of much longer binding profiles than current microarray-based methods.
	In addition, as our method is based on proteins expressed in mammalian
	cells, it can also be used to characterize DNA-binding preferences
	of full-length proteins or proteins requiring post-translational
	modifications. We validate the method by determining binding specificities
	of 14 different classes of TFs and by confirming the specificities
	for NFATC1 and RFX3 using ChIP-seq. Our results reveal unexpected
	dimeric modes of binding for several factors that were thought to
	preferentially bind DNA as monomers.},

  abstract = {Genomic array technologies provide a means for profiling global changes
	in gene expression under a variety of conditions. However, it has
	been difficult to assess whether transcriptional or posttranscriptional
	regulation is responsible for these changes. Additionally, fluctuations
	in gene expression in a single cell type within a complex tissue
	like a tumor may be masked by overlapping profiles of all cell types
	in the population. In this paper, we describe the use of cDNA arrays
	to identify subsets of mRNAs contained in endogenous messenger ribonucleoprotein
	complexes (mRNPs) that are cell type specific. We identified mRNA
	subsets from P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells by using mRNA-binding
	proteins HuB, eIF-4E, and PABP that are known to play a role in translation.
	The mRNA profiles associated with each of these mRNPs were unique
	and represented gene clusters that differed from total cellular RNA.
	Additionally, the composition of mRNAs detected in HuB-mRNP complexes
	changed dramatically after induction of neuronal differentiation
	with retinoic acid. We suggest that the association of structurally
	related mRNAs into mRNP complexes is dynamic and may help regulate
	posttranscriptional events such as mRNA turnover and translation.
	Recovering proteins specifically associated with mRNP complexes to
	identify and profile endogenously clustered mRNAs should provide
	insight into structural and functional relationships among gene transcripts
	and/or their protein products. We have termed this approach to functional
	genomics ribonomics and suggest that it will provide a useful paradigm
	for organizing genomic information in a biologically relevant manner.},

  abstract = {High-affinity nucleic acid ligands for a protein were isolated by
	a procedure that depends on alternate cycles of ligand selection
	from pools of variant sequences and amplification of the bound species.
	Multiple rounds exponentially enrich the population for the highest
	affinity species that can be clonally isolated and characterized.
	In particular one eight-base region of an RNA that interacts with
	the T4 DNA polymerase was chosen and randomized. Two different sequences
	were selected by this procedure from the calculated pool of 65,536
	species. One is the wild-type sequence found in the bacteriophage
	mRNA; one is varied from wild type at four positions. The binding
	constants of these two RNA's to T4 DNA polymerase are equivalent.
	These protocols with minimal modification can yield high-affinity
	ligands for any protein that binds nucleic acids as part of its function;
	high-affinity ligands could conceivably be developed for any target
	molecule.},
