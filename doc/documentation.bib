  abstract = {Deciphering the noncoding regulatory genome has proved a formidable
        challenge. Despite the wealth of available gene expression data,
        there currently exists no broadly applicable method for characterizing
        the regulatory elements that shape the rich underlying dynamics.
        We present a general framework for detecting such regulatory DNA
        and RNA motifs that relies on directly assessing the mutual information
        between sequence and gene expression measurements. Our approach makes
        minimal assumptions about the background sequence model and the mechanisms
        by which elements affect gene expression. This provides a versatile
        motif discovery framework, across all data types and genomes, with
        exceptional sensitivity and near-zero false-positive rates. Applications
        from yeast to human uncover putative and established transcription-factor
        binding and miRNA target sites, revealing rich diversity in their
        spatial configurations, pervasive co-occurrences of DNA and RNA motifs,
        context-dependent selection for motif avoidance, and the strong impact
        of posttranscriptional processes on eukaryotic transcriptomes.},

        From its origins in data analysis{,} the parallel tempering method
        has become a standard workhorse of physicochemical simulations. We
        discuss the theory behind the method and its various generalizations.
        We mention a selected set of the many applications that have become
        possible with the introduction of parallel tempering{,} and we suggest
        several promising avenues for future research.},
