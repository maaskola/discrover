* Implement different motif models
  - simple chain of states - done
  - chain of states with manual insertion states - done
  - chain of states with all insertion states
  - chain of states with insertion and deletion states / Eddy's plan 7
* Use other regular expression based motif finding tools for seeding
* Shuffle sequences for discriminative learning when only one set of sequences is given
* Search one strand against the other
* Find localized motifs
* Limit maximal degeneracy of MCMC and FIRE seeding
* Parallelize FIRE and parallel tempering
* Put branch into --version
