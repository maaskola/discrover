* Implement different motif models
  - simple chain of states - done
  - chain of states with manual insertion states - done
  - chain of states with all insertion states
  - chain of states with insertion and deletion states / Eddy's plan 7
* Use further regular expression based motif finding tools for seeding
* Search one strand against the other
* Find localized motifs
* MCMC
  * Parallelize parallel tempering
  * MCMC seeding can sample across motif lengths
  * Collect rejection statistics for MCMC chains
* Improve naming of shuffled sequences in HMM
* Should only the new dynamic padding be used, or should also the old, fixed n-padding be kept?
  - perhaps for simplicity of the interface it would be good to dispose of the old style
* Unify the scoring code of plasma and hmm
* write random salt into .hmm file
* try the Polak-Rebiere formula for conjugate gradient descent (see Greiner & al 2005)
  - unfortunately, this does not seem to mesh well with hybrid learning
* Viterbi decoding occurrence counting is broken when using --padl > 0
* Provide the discovered motifs as .HMM files with the software distribution
* test to see if the numerical issues due to MT persist, and if they can be ameliorated
* print out MCC, DIPS, log likelihood difference for individual contrast eval

CMake Warning (dev) at doc/CMakeLists.txt:19 (GET_PROPERTY):
  Policy CMP0026 is not set: Disallow use of the LOCATION target property.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0026" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The LOCATION property should not be read from target "plasma-bin".  Use the
  target name directly with add_custom_command, or use the generator
  expression $<TARGET_FILE>, as appropriate.

Either install hmm.rb into a proper location or merge into tikzlogo / hmm2meme
