* Implement different motif models
  - simple chain of states - done
  - chain of states with manual insertion states - done
  - chain of states with all insertion states
  - chain of states with insertion and deletion states / Eddy's plan 7
* Use other regular expression based motif finding tools for seeding
* Search one strand against the other
* Find localized motifs
* Parallelize parallel tempering
* Add RNG seed specification for all parts requiring randomization
  - MCMC
* MCMC seeding can sample across motif lengths
* Collect rejection statistics for MCMC chains
* Improve naming of shuffled sequences in HMM
* Should only the new dynamic padding be used, or should also the old, fixed n-padding be kept?
  - perhaps for simplicity of the interface it would be good to dispose of the old style
* Unify the scoring code of plasma and hmm
* write random salt into .hmm file
* try the Polak-Rebiere formula for conjugate gradient descent (see Greiner & al 2005)
  - unfortunately, this does not seem to mesh well with hybrid learning
* Viterbi decoding occurrence counting is broken when using --padl > 0
* Provide the discovered motifs as .HMM files with the software distribution
* Specifying the number of threads with the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS doesn't work
* test to see if the numerical issues due to MT persist, and if they due whether they can be ameliorated
* print out MCC, DIPS, log likelihood difference for individual contrast eval

Update INSTALL and README.md regarding the default installation directory (and fix the layout issue with the headings)
