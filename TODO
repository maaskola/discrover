* Implement different motif models
  - simple chain of states - done
  - chain of states with manual insertion states - done
  - chain of states with all insertion states
  - chain of states with insertion and deletion states / Eddy's plan 7
* Use other regular expression based motif finding tools for seeding
* Search one strand against the other
* Find localized motifs
* Parallelize FIRE and parallel tempering
* Add RNG seed specification for all parts requiring randomization
  - MCMC
* MCMC seeding can sample across motif lengths
* Collect rejection statistics for MCMC chains
* Improve naming of shuffled sequences in HMM
